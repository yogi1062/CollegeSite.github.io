                      A very warm welcome to the Department of Civil Engineering runs by prestigious Ashokrao Mane group of Institutions.

                    Civil engineering is deemed to be the oldest and most respected discipline of all engineering fields. Civil engineers design, build, and manage the infrastructure of civilization, which includes buildings, bridges, highways, water supply systems, and other public works. These services are the cornerstone of the discipline, although no longer the limiting scope. The civil and environmental engineering programs include structural engineering, structural mechanics, geotechnical engineering, earthquake engineering, hydrology and water resources engineering, and environmental engineering.
                    
                    The noteworthy remark about the department is that “Civil Engineering program is NBA accredited". The institute is NAAC Accredited with 'A’ grade with CGPA 3.08 and has acquired ISO 9001-2008 certificate.
                    
                    The Department with its excellent infrastructure, state of the art laboratories and computing facilities is providing unlimited opportunity to the students for enhancing their potential & abilities. The department also extends services to the societal and industrial needs through consultancy. The department has fine blend of experienced and young dynamic faculty members having expertise of various domains in civil engineering. The civil engineering students are encouraged to organize and participate in various curricular and co-curricular activities through Civil Engineering Students Association (CESA). <br>
